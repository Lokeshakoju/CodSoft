# CodeSoft Internship Tasks

## Overview
I had the privilege of undertaking an internship at CodeSoft, where I served as a Java Development Intern. This experience has been both enriching and rewarding, providing me with valuable insights into the dynamic world of Java and its applications.

## Tasks Completed
During my internship, I successfully completed a range of tasks that enhanced my skills and knowledge in the field. Some of the key tasks include:

## Task 02 - STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR

Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.

Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.

Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the
average percentage.

Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.

Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user

This program is designed to assist students in evaluating their academic performance based on the marks obtained in various subjects. By providing the marks achieved in each subject (out of 100), the program calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a corresponding grade. The results are then displayed to the user for quick reference.

## Task 04 - CURRENCY CONVERTER

Currency Selection: Allow the user to choose the base currency and the target
currency.

Currency Rates: Fetch real-time exchange rates from a reliable API.

Amount Input: Take input from the user for the amount they want to convert.

Currency Conversion: Convert the input amount from the base currency to the
target currency using the fetched exchange rate.

Display Result: Show the converted amount and the target currenY symbol to the user.

This Java program facilitates effortless currency conversion by enabling users to choose the base and target currencies, fetching real-time exchange rates from a reliable API. Users input the amount they want to convert, and the program swiftly performs the currency conversion, displaying the converted amount along with the target currency symbol.

## Task05 - STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1. Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll
number, grade, and any other relevant details.

2. Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include
methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.

3 . Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based
interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.

4. Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a
database.

5. Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all
students, and exiting the application.

6. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student
data is in the correct format.

This Java application manages student information through a user-friendly interface, allowing users to add, remove, search, and display student details. The system ensures data persistence by implementing methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database. Users can interact with the system seamlessly, with options for adding new students, editing existing information, searching for students, displaying all records, and exiting the application.
